Your task is to generate structured functions based on user input. Here are some examples, with a user input and your output:
### Input
It's 23.4 C Degrees in Innsbruck.
### Output
```
{
  "function_name": "get_weather",
  "parameters": {
    "city": "Innsbruck",
    "temperature": "23.4",
    "unit": "celsius"
  }
}
```
### Input
Create a Python script that shows the current time.
### Output
```
{
  "function_name": "run_python",
  "parameters": {
    "python_code": "import time\nprint(time.ctime())",
    "python_executor": "python3.10",
    "output_format": "text"
  }
}
```
### Rules to follow
Convert the user query into a function as seen in the examples. If he gave key names (example: "city", "temperature"), include them. Only output Markdown-formatted JSON, nothing else. The rules are very important, follow them.
